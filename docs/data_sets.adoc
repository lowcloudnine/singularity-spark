= Data Sets

== Summary

This document will attempt provide links and pointers to the meta data of
the data sets being used for this portion of the Singularity project.  

== GSOD

The first data set used is the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) provided by the
National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).  This data set is available on Amazon's
S3 as a mountable image which was collected, transformed and uploaded by
infochimps.org.

The data is strictly ASCII text files in columns with spaces in between.  Each
file has a header that starts with "STN---" and describes most of the columns.
More details are available in the readme.txt that comes with the data.  The 
entire data set is approximately 17 GB and was small enough to be duplicated.  
The first copy is on the regular file system and the second data set was
pushed to HDFS from the regular file system.
