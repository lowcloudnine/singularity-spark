= Singularity Spark

This is a relatively simple project to stand up and test Apache Spark.  The
project will follow a simple path:

==== Phase 1
* stand up and use Spark on a single node
* test the single instance against a specific data set
* install a IPython notebook server and test against the single node Spark
* test the IPython server agains the same data set
* record the difference

==== Phase 2
* stand up and use Spark on a multi-node cluster
* test the cluster against the same data set from Phase 1 with the same tests
* install IPython server for use on the cluster
* compare cluster performance agains cluster performance
* compare IPython performance against spark-submit performance

==== Phase 3
* convert all the test developed above to Scala and run them
* compare Scala performance to Python performance

==== Phase 4
* import the given data set into Accumulo and then test against said data
set to see what performance differences there are
